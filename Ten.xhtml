<font face="Tahoma">Social arena is another significant role difference between males and females in Afghanistan.</font>
<font face="Z003">In Afghan society, girls were always deprived of playing their roles and rights. To exemplify, during the Taliban era, females did not allow to study and do sports activities like biking. In the Taliban era, women could not choose their husbands; instead, their parent's selection was important. So, females who were involved with forced marriage had not the role of deciding in Afghani culture.</font><font face=""> In contrast, men are freer in Afghanistan to play their roles. Thus, men are free to continue their education and do any sports activities. Also, men have the right to purpose to their favorite girls and they are allow to marry with four girls. Therefore, men are free from forced marriage and education deprived.</font>
<font face="Georgia">To conclude, independence is another contrast between men’s and women’s roles in Afghani culture.</font>
